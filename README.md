# weight-lifting-app

An app to record my workout each session.

Created using the `expo init weight-lifting-app` command from [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation.

To run this locally, 

1. in Terminal navigate to `~/Documents/DevFiles/personal_projects/weight-lifting-app`
2. run `yarn start`
3. in the browser navigate to `http://localhost:19002/`


## Next Steps

* Create `basicStructure` branch

* set up basic outline of each component - what is needed and where

* each time the addButton is selected, a new component needs to be added

* it's respective removeButton needs to remove just that one component.

* then the state needs to be preserved so that when the app is closed, those added components are kept....

* maybe have the removeButton and addButton both be replaced with a single button?
