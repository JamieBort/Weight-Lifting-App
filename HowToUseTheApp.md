1. First set up routines.

2. Select the routine or cardio activity.

Thought process for creating routines:
1. Weight, make these choices

    i. Name it something - in this case name it Leg Day.
    ii. Choose an exercise type - in this case weight. (Instead of cardio or flexibility.)
    iii. There is a countdown timer with a default setting. To be used between sets.

        a. Leave it alone.
        b. change the default time.
        c. Or remove the default timer. (this will be replaced with a button to add it back in)

    iv. Now add an exercise. - this button loads an exercise component.

        d. It has a button to remove this exercise.
        e. the tpe of exercises is determined by 1ii. above. So from the menu you can choose only weight type exercises. (list them by name? muscle group? combo? type it out? etc. tbd.)

2. Flexibility, make these choices

    v. Name it something - in this case name it ___.

3. Cardio, make these choices

    vi. In fact there is nothing to set up. Instead select the activity and start recording/timing/etc.
